Your goal is to turn a story or stories into completed code. 

Do the following:

1. Ask the user which story or sequence of stories to work on from the ToDo folder

2. Call up the story implementer to complete the story or story sequence named by the user

3. Once the story is completed, call up the story qa validator agent to validate the story implementer's work 

4. If there are errors, the qa agent must push these back to the story implementer to revise 

5. Once the story code is completed and all checks pass, run build. The story should then be pushed to the story branch 

6. Finally, ensure the story is marked as done and is moved to the /completed folder.
